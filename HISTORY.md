Version: 2.0.2

Published Date: 2018-03-06

### Changes

Added functionality to allow multiple WordPress stacks to be launched and running concurrently.

Changed name of sample cli script from aws-refarch-wordpress-sample-cli.sh to aws-refarch-wordpress-sample-cli-newvpc.sh and changed the parameter file and master template referenced in the create-stack command from aws-refarch-wordpress-parameters.json to aws-refarch-wordpress-parameters-newvpc.json and aws-refarch-wordpress-master.yaml to aws-refarch-wordpress-master-newvpc.yaml respectively.

Hint: Will soon be adding a new master template to launch this stack into an existing vpc.

Added more sample values to the aws-refarch-wordpress-parameters-newvpc.json sample parameter file.

Added Author and License metadata to each template.

#### Master Template
Changed name of master template. Added "-newvpc" suffix.
[aws-refarch-wordpress-master-newvpc.yaml](templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-master-newvpc.yaml)

- Changed DatabaseMasterUsername MinLength constraint to 8, to align with the minimum length for Amazon RDS. Added "(minimum 8; maximum 16)" to the constraint description.

- Dropped passing the "ElastiCacheClusterName" parameter "!Ref DatabaseName" to the ElastiCache stack. ClusterName attribute is no longer provided when creating AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster. This will allow a unique identifier to be generated as the ClusterName.

## RDS Template
Review the template here [aws-refarch-wordpress-04-web.yaml](templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-04-web.yaml)

- Changed DatabaseMasterUsername MinLength constraint to 8, to align with the minimum length for Amazon RDS. Added "(minimum 8; maximum 16)" to the constraint description.

## ElastiCache Template
Review the template here [aws-refarch-wordpress-03-elasticache.yaml](templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-03-elasticache.yaml)

- Dropped passing the "ElastiCacheClusterName" parameter "!Ref DatabaseName" to the ElastiCache stack. ClusterName attribute is no longer provided when creating AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster. This will allow a unique identifier to be generated as the ClusterName. This will help allow for multiple WordPress stacks to be launched and running concurrently.

- CacheSubnetGroupName attributed is no longer provided when creating AWS::ElastiCache::SubnetGroup. This will allow a unique identifier to be generated as the CacheSubnetGroupName. This will help allow for multiple WordPress stacks to be launched and running concurrently.

## EFS Alarms Template
Review the template here [aws-refarch-wordpress-03-efsalarms.yaml](templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-03-efsalarms.yaml)

- Added alarm dependencies so alarms will be created serially and not in parallel.

## Amazon EFS Alarms Template
Review the template here [aws-refarch-wordpress-03-efsalarms.yaml](templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-03-efsalarms.yaml)
This is a new template & stack.
Depends on efsfilesystem stack & the CreateAlarm parameter
This AWS CloudFormation template will create two Amazon CloudWatch alarms that will send email notifications if the burst credit balance drops below two predefined thresholds, a 'Warning' threshold and a 'Critical' threshold. These thresholds are based on the number of minutes it would take to completely use all burst credits if the file system was being driven at the highest throughput rate possible, the permitted throughput rate. You enter these minute variables as input parameters in the Cloudformation template. The 'Warning' threshold and has a default value of 180 minutes. This means that a CloudWatch alarm will send an email notification 180 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. The second alarm and notification is a 'Critical' notification and has a default value of 60 minutes. This alarm will send an email notification 60 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. Permitted throughput is dynamic, scaling up as the file systems grows and scaling down as the file system shrinks. Therefore a third and fourth alarm is create that monitors permitted throughput. If the permitted throughput increases or decreases, an email notification is sent and an Auto Scaling Group will launch an EC2 instance that dynamically resets the 'Warning' and 'Critical' thresholds based on the latest permitted throughput rate. This EC2 instance will auto terminate and a new instance will launch to reset the thresholds only when the permitted throughput rate increases or decreases. It will also create a custom CloudWatch metric to monitor EFS file system size using a Lambda function.
